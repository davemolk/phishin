The processes I took are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n1) Amplified both discs 175% across the board.\r\n2) Sampled a section of silence to obtain a decent noise floor\r\nsample (25,000 sample points used).\r\n3) Applied this sample against both discs at 64 percent.\r\n4) Applied a graphic equalizer to boost the high and low spectrums\r\n(specifically between 600 - 800 Hz and 8k \u0026 10 kHz).\r\n***Note: I cut everything above 11 kHz 18dB because nothing\r\nexisted above that freq. range on the original recording.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW NOTES by Hunter Seamons (12/31/06):\r\n\r\nI noticed the pitch was too high in both shows listed in this seed. I decreased the pitch in 12.01.84 by 7%, and I decreased the pitch in 10.17.85 by 9%.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMASTERED (12/01/07):\r\n\r\nAs this was my first seed, I naturally made some mistakes the first time around. I made all changes by going back to the original file set by Mike Wren and redoing the process, so this is as fresh as it gets. The new changes from my previous seed are as follows:\r\n\r\n1) SBE fix\r\n\r\n2) Encoded at 44.1 kHz (The last source I did was accidently encoded at a \"false\" 48 kHz. Whether this makes any difference sonically has not been determined.)\r\n\r\n3) Different speed reductions at 6% and 8%, respectively. (I believe I was a hair off the first time around, so I wanted to use this opportunity to make the changes.)\r\n\r\n4) NO CUTS! (I made some unorthodox, millisecond cuts before between songs, due to my inexperience of pitch correcting at the time. These went largely unnoticed, as far as I can tell.)\r\n\r\nThese changes should make this source better for the long haul.\r\n\r\nEnjoy this historic show on its 23rd anniversary!","updated_at":"2018-12-21T08:10:12Z","venue_name":"Nectar's","location":"Burlington, VT"}],"updated_at":"2013-11-26T00:03:57Z"}]}
